console.log(regularUser.fullname.userfullname); // now it is showing this --> { firstname: 'swastika', lastname: 'das' }

// so mainly if we want to acces object under object with specification we can access it by just adding "." and by the object name

console.log(obj3);

//so to overcome this problem if we want to join two objects-->

console.log(obj4); // o/p-->{ '1': 'a', '2': 'b', '3': 'a', '4': 'b' }

// the mlost used way to overcome the nested problem-->

console.log(Object.values(tinderUser)); // finding values of any objects

console.log(Object.entries(tinderUser)); // [ [ 'id', '132hjjh' ], [ 'name', 'swasti' ], [ 'isLoggedIn', false ] ] it gives the value like array within an array..every single property means one pair of key value will come in a array form

console.log(tinderUser.hasOwnProperty('isLoggedIn')); // it is used to check any value if it is present in it or not

// if we want to extract any value from any objects we can use this simple methods-->

//but if there is a need to print it or using it again and again it is not easy to every time we can type the same line so there is a different way to get rid from this-->
const {courseInstructor} = course
console.log(courseInstructor); // so now if we want to use it agian there is no need to write it like course.courseInstructor  instead of this we can simply write only the key like courseInstructor

//or if we want to give a short name to any key so we can use it again-->
const { courseInstructor: instructor } = course // now we can use this only "instructor" word in next lines..

// like-->
console.log(instructor);
