//number (range= 2 to the power 53)
//bigint

//null (itv is a standalone value)(null = given but intentionally empty.)
//undefined (Meaning: A variable is declared but not assigned any value.)
//Symbol (unique)


//object

console.log(typeof "swastika")
//it will ofc print the datatype that is string

console.log(typeof age)
//it will print the datatype as number

console.log(typeof null)
// it will define the datatype as OBJECT(exeptional)(so we have to remember it that NULL is object )

console.log(typeof undefined)
//but this undefined will show the datatype as undefined(but these undefined is not an object)
