// ----------------------------------------------------------------

//things to understand thorugh console: 

// all about querySelector-------->

//we can select any element by many queries like --->

//document.getElementbyId
// document.getElementbyClassName


// we have used span here and did style display:none to understand whats the diffrence between textContent and innerText

// if we do this-> title.innerText
// it will show us whatever is displayed on the screeen only

// and if we do this --> title.textContent
// it will show us the full text whatever is given as a input

// if we do --> title.innerHTML
// it will show us the total html value..and if there are some html values are present then it also show this. like here it will show [] DOM learning on Chai aur code <span style="display: none;">test text</span> ] so here span is also being showed..

// innerHTML supports html tags but innerText or textContent doesn't supports html tags

// some query selector ->

// document.querySelector('h1')
// it will select the 1st h1 tag

// document.querySelector('h2')
// it will give 1st h2 tag 

// now if we want to slect the unordered list one which is at line no 22..so we can also select this through querySelector
// so 1st we have to select total ul->
document.queryselector('ul')
// now we are storing it into a variable
const myul= document.queryselector('ul')
// now we are running query again on this variable...so now we can select those "one" word->
myul.querySelector('li')
// and queryselector always selects the 1st one so now "one" is selected

// we can also work over this "one"->
// like if we want to change the colour of the background we can do->
// 1st we can store it ino a variable->
const turnGreen = myul.querySelector('li')
turnGreen.style.backgroundColor="blue"
// also if we want to add padding we can also do this->

turnGreen.style.padding="10px"

// if we want to chnage the text "one" to "blabla" we can also do this->
//turnGreen.innerHTML
// it will give "one"
//then we can change->
turnGreen.innerText= "blabla"
// now it will change the text from "one" to "blabla"

//----------------------------------------------------------------

// querySelectorAll

// if we want to have all  list items--
document.querySelectorAll('li')
// it will give us nodelist

//let's put it under a variable
const templist = document.querySelectorAll('li')

so these nodelists are not at all pure array..and we can see this 

we need to always check if this is a real array by checking it's property..
and in this case we can see map is absent in the property though forEach is present..but we know that map is one of the default property of array..

now again if we want to add some style it will not support it because those are nodelist not array

const templist = document.querySelectorAll('li')
templist.style.color ="green"
// it will show error as i have already mentioned that it is not at all array

but we can work with it through index -->
templist[0].style.color ="green"

// now it will turn the text "one" into green color.

another example of nodelist using->

const myH1 = document.querySelectorAll('h1')
//since the file is containing only one h1 so it will only return this...but again if we want to add any style we can't add simply like without index though it is single value still we have to use indexing-->

myH1[0].style.color = "blue"
