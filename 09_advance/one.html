<!--
    1st we need to understand what is API-- API is nothing but a interface between two programs that can be frontend backend , that can ve java and JS , that can be ryby and java whatever..

    so if we want to know a structure of an API->

    1st go on a randomuser api and then p generate one and then open famous json formatter and paste the data..

    and then select how you wanna see the structure..preferable to choose tree..then it shows how many objects are there and their property
